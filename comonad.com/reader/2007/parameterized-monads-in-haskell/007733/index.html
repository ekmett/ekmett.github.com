<div class="post-info"><h2 class="post-title"><a href="../index.html" rel="bookmark" title="Permanent Link: Parameterized Monads in Haskell">Parameterized Monads in Haskell</a></h2>
Posted by Edward Kmett under <a href="../../../category/haskell/index.html" title="View all posts in Haskell" rel="category tag">Haskell</a> ,  <a href="../../../category/monads/index.html" title="View all posts in Monads" rel="category tag">Monads</a> ,  <a href="../../../category/type-theory/index.html" title="View all posts in Type Theory" rel="category tag">Type Theory</a> <br/><a href="../index.html#comments" title="Comment on Parameterized Monads in Haskell">[5] Comments</a>&nbsp;</div>
<div class="post-content">
	<p>Recently <a href="http://www.randomhacks.net/articles/2007/03/15/data-set-monad-haskell-macros">Eric Kidd</a> and <a href="http://sigfpe.blogspot.com/2007/06/how-to-write-tolerably-efficient.html">Dan Piponi</a> have used a bit of <a href="http://okmij.org/ftp/Haskell/types.html#restricted-datatypes">type hackery by Oleg Kiselyov</a> and -fno-implicit-prelude to build some interesting restricted monads, like the Wadler Set and Bag monads.</p>
<p>There is another interesting monad variation - a parameterized monad - where the monad carries around an additional parameter at the type level such as a type-level set of effects. One really good example of this is the separation logic monad in <a href="http://www.eecs.harvard.edu/~aleks/papers/hoarelogic/jfpsep07.pdf">Hoare Type Theory</a>. The pre- and post- conditions can be viewed as the parameter carried around on that monad. <a href="http://citeseer.ist.psu.edu/254302.html">Wadler and Thiemann</a>, <a href="type.http_/citeseer.ist.psu.edu/273929.html">Jean-Christophe Filliâtre</a> and others have explore this notion for encoding effects.</p>
<p><span id="more-41"></span></p>
<p>This prompts the question of if parameterized monads can be implemented directly in Haskell. Indeed they can, but a simple version fails with the signature:</p>
<p><code type="haskell"><br />
class BadHaskell m p p' p'' | p p' -> p'' where<br />
    return :: a -> m p a<br />
    fail :: a -> m p a<br />
    (>>=) :: m p a -> (a -> m p' a) -> m p'' a<br />
</code></p>
<p>This of course runs afoul of the fact that all of the parameters are not mentioned in return, so we have to break it apart into two or three classes.</p>
<p><code type="haskell"><br />
class Return m p where<br />
    return :: a -> m p a</p>
<p>class Fail m p where<br />
    fail :: String -> m p a</p>
<p>class Bind m p p' p'' | p p' -> p'' where<br />
    (>>=) :: m p a -> (a -> m p' a) -> m p'' a<br />
</code></p>
<p>By splitting off fail, we can make it so that it is illegal to use an incomplete pattern on certain monads, a small win, but it may be useful in a later post.</p>
<p>However, there turns out to be quite some awkwardness from the perspective of type inference with this type. In particular we are used to the types of our monads being able to be inferred from the type of their results, but we lose this inference on return. Moreover, we can't just use existing monads under this syntax, we'd have to lift them into a newtype that accepted the additional parameter. </p>
<p>Ignoring the problems with existing monads, and correcting the type inference problem directly by adding fundeps doesn't help as </p>
<p><code type="haskell"><br />
class Bind m p p' p''<br />
  | p -> p' p''<br />
  , p' -> p p''<br />
  , p'' -> p p'<br />
  where<br />
    (>>=) :: m p a -> (a -> m p' a) -> m p'' a<br />
</code></p>
<p>is too restrictive and could be shown that under a strict interpretation of the laws, would never be able to be made to satisfy the monad laws except in the base case, because of the inability to construct an associative operation combining the parameters that isn't trivial.</p>
<p>As an aside, speaking of failing monad laws, it is interesting to note that the Set restricted monad actually fails a monad law given that functions in haskell need not respect equality, since <img src='../../../../latex/897b3c5aa597494b81ac92874455d7af.png' title='x = y =&gt; f x = f y' alt='x = y =&gt; f x = f y' align=absmiddle> fails to hold in general for user defined equality as used by the Set monad, as noted by Andrea Vezzosi on #haskell, the order of association can make a difference as to the result of the computation. This is arguably a minor quibble as you wouldn't be using it unless you knew the type you were going to pass around and how your functions worked on it with respect to its notion of equality.</p>
<p>Turning back to the issue of being unable to pass traditional monads into this type, we realize that having a separate m and p parameters to the type class is redundant as you can generate an equivalent notion by letting m vary.</p>
<p><code type="haskell"><br />
class Return m where<br />
    return :: a -> m a</p>
<p>class Fail m where<br />
    fail :: String -> m a</p>
<p>class Bind m m' m'' | m m' -> m'' where<br />
    (>>=) :: m a -> (a -> m' a) -> m'' a<br />
</code></p>
<p>This still has the problem that the type of return is not inferable, but now at least we can derive instances of these classes for instances of Monad. Of course, if we create a generic instance for </p>
<p><code type="haskell"><br />
import qualified Control.Monad as Old<br />
instance Old.Monad m => Bind m m m where (>>=) = (Old.>>=)<br />
...<br />
</code></p>
<p>we then run afoul of the fact that we can't define any other interesting instances because the compiler won't know which way to go with type class inference.</p>
<p>However, even without that we can import each monad in turn, and define some interesting interfaces between them:</p>
<p><code type="haskell"><br />
instance Bind Maybe [] [] where<br />
    Just a >>= f = f a<br />
    Nothing >>= _ = []</p>
<p>-- testMaybeList :: [Int] = [2,4]<br />
testMaybeList = Just 2 >>= \x -> [x*1,x*2]<br />
</code></p>
<p>Admittedly there is an <img src='../../../../latex/6595d679e306a127a3fe53268bcaddb2.png' title='n^2' alt='n^2' align=absmiddle> combinatorial explosion of combinations and not all of them have clear semantics, but we can choose to implement only the ones that have an unambiguous interpretation and leave off the rest and pay as we go, implementing them as needed. A more mature version of this might provide an interesting alternative/supplement to the MTL approach and can be viewed as a limited fragment of <a href="http://citeseer.ist.psu.edu/619712.html">Lüth and Ghani's monad composition through coproducts</a>.</p>
<p>However, we still haven't solved the return problem, but it turns out that monad laws can come to the rescue. </p>
<p>If we start to implement a number of these we notice a pattern when it comes to the Identity monad. In general we can define instances of Bind for the Identity monad for any monad presuming we can liftM, to handle the case on the right, but since liftM requires a sort of circular dependency loop, we choose to make Bind enforce the availability of fmap, allow overlapping instances, and then define:</p>
<p><code type="haskell"><br />
class (Functor m, Functor m', Functor m'') => Bind m m' m''<br />
 | m m' -> m''<br />
  where<br />
    (>>=) :: m a -> (a -> m' b) -> (m'' b)<br />
    (>>)  :: m a -> m' b -> m'' b<br />
    m >> k = m >>= const k</p>
<p>instance Functor a => Bind Identity a a where<br />
    m >>= f = f (runIdentity m)</p>
<p>instance Functor a => Bind a Identity a where<br />
    m >>= f = fmap (runIdentity . f) m</p>
<p>-- and to disambiguate between the above instances...<br />
instance Bind Identity Identity Identity where<br />
    m >>= f = f (runIdentity m)<br />
</code></p>
<p>The correctness of this is in fact enforced by the monad laws as these instances can be read as the familiar laws once you remove the noise of the Identity monad:</p>
<p><code type="haskell"><br />
     return m >>= f = f m<br />
     m >>= return . f = fmap f m<br />
     return m >>= f = f m<br />
</code></p>
<p>This gives us a single natural notion of return for all monads that we can use and still glue together via >>=:</p>
<p><code type="haskell"><br />
class Return m where<br />
    returnM :: a -> m a</p>
<p>return :: a -> Identity a<br />
return = Old.return<br />
</code></p>
<p>Now the problem is if you write a statement like <code type="haskell">return 2 >>= \x -> return (x+1)</code>, you can have the Identity type percolate out of your monad expression, even when you were expecting a ListT or State monad or something more interesting, so we need a way to transform values from the Identity monad to an arbitrary monad for use when you want its type to conform to an external signature. </p>
<p><code type="haskell"><br />
class Go n m where<br />
        go :: n a -> m a</p>
<p>instance Return a => Go Identity a where<br />
    go = returnM . runIdentity<br />
instance Go a a where<br />
    go = id<br />
</code></p>
<p>So, now we can tell our code to <code type="haskell">go (do something)</code> and it will transform any lingering Identities to whatever monadic type is inferred for the go statement in its current context.</p>
<p>This has the advantage that pure fragments in our monadic sugar can avoid carrying around the rest of the monadic plumbing, even though they use the same bind operator to string it all together.</p>
<p>We can perform similar surgery on the MonadPlus class, tearing it apart into two pieces, breaking out a canonical mzero implementation as a trivial monad that just projects everything to bottom, and having Go erase any lingering mzeros that percolate out of our expression. Rather than reproduce it here, I point to a darcs repository that I just created. You can use darcs to get <a href="http://comonad/com/haskell/monad-param">http://comonad/com/haskell/monad-param</a> or pull the package from hackage. The interesting bits are in Control.Monad.Parameterized and <a href="../../../../haskell/monad-param/dist/doc/html/Control-Monad-Parameterized.html">HTML documentation is available</a>.</p>
<p>This package re-exports the MTL and STM monads to avoid the requirement that the end user explicitly import Control.Monad.* masking off the members of Control.Monad each time and it provides some interesting mixins. </p>
<p>Caveat: It appears that GHC enforces the fact that the arguments and results of (>>=) must have a signature like</p>
<p><code type="haskell">(>>=) :: forall m a. (...) => m a -> (a -> m b) -> m b</code></p>
<p>insofar as when you use the do-sugar, your types will not be able to vary. Ideally it should be able to get by with a more liberal signature, but it seems like no one has needed it before now.</p>

			<p>Oleg represented parameterized monads differently:<br />
<a href="http://www.haskell.org/pipermail/haskell-prime/2006-February/000498.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.haskell.org/pipermail/haskell-prime/2006-February/000498.html</a></p>
<p>The way to think about parameterized monads is that they are like monads except there is mutable state at compile time. In other words, each action in a parameterized monad has a start state and an end state that is checked at compile time: the end state of one action must match the start state of the next action.</p>

			<p>It seems that Oleg&#8217;s version mentioned there was the one I linked to above for a form of restricted monad, where the parameter passed to the monad is restricted as to the types it can take, limiting it to being an endofunctor supporting injections from a portion of the category smaller than the whole of the category of all types. </p>
<p>Unfortunately that isn&#8217;t so useful for the part of this I was working up next. </p>
<p>What I need (for something else) is a monad that could contain anything, but where I could either vary a type parameter which can be done through a fairly boring MTL-style bit of typeclass hackery, in which case all of the nice examples in the parameterized monad module would require a lot of &#8216;lift&#8217; style plumbing or where I could change out the monad itself, which was the path I decided to try out.</p>
<p>The main reason I decided to write out the above was because of the fairly interesting (to me anyways) property that by employing the monad laws we get back a notion of type inference for that weakened type for bind.</p>
<p>Er.. that is unless you are referring to somewhere else where Oleg wrote up another form of parameterized monad. Which is quite likely, as I&#8217;ve just grown to assume anything worth doing in Haskell or Scheme has already been done by him and is just waiting for someone to come along and read the message on the mailing list.</p>

			<p>[...] It seems that a module has already been written to encode parameterised modules and uploaded to Hackage: Control.Monad.Parameterized (package monad-param). It dates from before the current excitement (2007 and it&#8217;s at version 0.0.2) so the concept is apparently not new. It does however take a somewhat different approach, one that&#8217;s seemingly more general but also more cumbersome. The change in approach is explained in a blog post by its author, Edward Kmett. Here&#8217;s what the &#8220;parameterized monad&#8221; class would look like if translated from the paper:  &gt; class PMonad m where &gt;     returnP :: a -&gt; m p p a &gt;     (&gt;&gt;&gt;=)  :: m p1 p2 a -&gt; (a -&gt; m p2 p3 b) -&gt; m p1 p3 b [...]</p>
